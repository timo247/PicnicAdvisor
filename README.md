# ShroomShare
REST API allowing users to localize where they can gather mushrooms.
The users go into the wild in search for mushrooms. Once they find mushrooms, they picture them and describe them. They then can create a gathering place, which is a physical place containing wild mushrooms.
The other users of the app can then go to the gathering place and confirm whether or not they found mushrooms. Any user can create a gathering place, which is physically in a radius of 1km of where the picture has been taken.
